# Knights Travails
## Description
The main function knightMoves shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way. [The project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s curriculum. The Odin Project provides a high quality web development education maintained by an open source community.
## Live Preview
Open up your [developer console](https://haminimi.github.io/binary-knights-travails/) to see all possible moves for the knight from each square on the chessboard. To find the shortest path, you can call the main knightMoves method with the starting and ending positions as parameters, like this: 
```javascript
chessboard.knightMoves([0,0],[7,7]) 
```
and you will get an output like this one: 
```javascript
['0,0', '1,2', '0,4', '1,6', '3,7', '5,6', '7,7']
```
